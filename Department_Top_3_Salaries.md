## âœ… Solution Using CTE and Dense Rank

```sql
WITH dept_rank AS (
    SELECT 
        departmentId,
        e.name AS employee,
        d.name AS department,
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY departmentId, d.name 
            ORDER BY salary DESC
        ) AS rank_val
    FROM employee e
    INNER JOIN department d
        ON e.departmentId = d.id
)

SELECT department, employee, salary
FROM dept_rank
WHERE rank_val <= 3
ORDER BY salary DESC;
