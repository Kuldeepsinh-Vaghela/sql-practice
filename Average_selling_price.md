# Average Selling Price

**LeetCode Problem:** [Average Selling Price](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Description

Given two tables: `Prices` and `UnitsSold`, calculate the **average selling price** per `product_id`.

- The `Prices` table defines the price of a product during a date range (`start_date` to `end_date`).
- The `UnitsSold` table contains individual records for product sales on specific `purchase_date`s.

Return a result that shows the `product_id` and its **average selling price**, calculated as:


If a product has **no units sold**, its average price should be **0**.

## âœ… Final SQL Solution

```sql
WITH cleaned_prod_unt_pr AS (
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(us.product_id, p.product_id) AS product_id, 
        CASE 
            WHEN us.units > 0 THEN us.units
            ELSE NULL
        END AS cleaned_units,

        END AS cleaned_price
    FROM UnitsSold us
    JOIN Prices p
        ON us.product_id = p.product_id 
       AND us.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
)

SELECT 
    product_id, 
    COALESCE(
        ROUND(SUM(cleaned_units * cleaned_price) * 1.0 / SUM(cleaned_units), 2),
        0
    ) AS average_price
FROM cleaned_prod_unt_pr
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY product_id;
