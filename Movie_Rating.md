## ðŸ§© Problem Description

You are given two tables:

### `Movie`  
| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| movie_id    | int     |
| title       | varchar |

### `Rating`  
| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |
| movie_id    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
| created_at  | date    |

The goal is to:

1. Find the name of the user who rated the most number of movies. If there is a tie, return the user with the **lexicographically smallest name**.
2. Find the name of the movie with the highest average rating in **February 2020**. If there is a tie, return the movie with the **lexicographically smallest title**.
