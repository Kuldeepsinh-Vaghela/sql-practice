SELECT 
    ral.card_name, 
    ral.total_monthly_amount - rar.total_monthly_amount AS difference
FROM ranked_monthly_card_amount ral
JOIN ranked_monthly_card_amount rar
    ON ral.card_name = rar.card_name
LEFT JOIN card_max_min_rank_no cmn
    ON rar.card_name = cmn.card_name
WHERE ral.rank_no = cmn.max_rank_no 
  AND rar.rank_no = cmn.min_rank_no
ORDER BY difference DESC;
