# SQL Query: Calculating Days Between First and Last Post of the Year for Active Users

## Problem Statement
We need to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post and last post of the year 2021, but only for users who posted at least twice in 2021.

### Assumptions:
- The `posts` table contains data on Facebook posts, with details including user ID, post ID, content, and the post date.
- We need to consider only users who posted **at least twice** in 2021.
- The goal is to calculate the number of days between the first and last post of each user in 2021.

## Table: `posts`
| Column Name   | Type      |
|---------------|-----------|
| user_id       | integer   |
| post_id       | integer   |
| post_content  | text      |
| post_date     | timestamp |

## Example Input:
| user_id | post_id | post_content                                           | post_date             |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 151652  | 599415  | Need a hug                                             | 07/10/2021 12:00:00   |

| 004239  | 784254  | Happy 4th of July!                                     | 07/04/2021 11:00:00   |
| 661093  | 442560  | Just going to cry myself to sleep after watching Marley and Me. | 07/08/2021 14:00:00   |

## Example Output:
| user_id | days_between |
|---------|--------------|
| 151652  | 2            |
| 661093  | 21           |

---

## Explanation:
- **User 151652**: Their first post in 2021 was on **July 10** and their last post was on **July 12**, which gives a difference of **2 days**.
- **User 661093**: Their first post was on **July 8** and their last post was on **July 29**, giving a difference of **21 days**.

## Additional Notes:
This query helps identify the activity span of users who posted multiple times in a year, and could be useful in understanding user engagement trends for a specific year.

## SQL Query:
```sql
select user_id, days_between
from (SELECT user_id, extract(DAY from (max(post_date) - min(post_date))) as days_between
FROM posts
where post_date between '01/01/2021 00:00:00' and '12/31/2021 24:00:00' 
group by user_id
order by user_id) as sub_1
where days_between > 0;
