## Problem Description

This SQL problem is part of the [Top SQL 50](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/top-sql-50/) study plan on LeetCode.

You're given an `Employee` table with the columns: `employee_id`, `department_id`, and `primary_flag`. Each employee can belong to one or more departments, and the `primary_flag` indicates which department is primary (`'Y'`) for that employee.

Your task is to return each employeeâ€™s primary department. If an employee belongs to only one department, that should be returned even if `primary_flag` is not `'Y'`.

## SQL Solution

```sql
WITH emp_count AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id, 
        COUNT(employee_id) AS cnt_emp_id
    FROM 
        employee
    GROUP BY 
        employee_id
    ORDER BY 
        employee_id
)

SELECT 
    e.employee_id, 
    e.department_id
FROM 
    employee e 
LEFT JOIN 
    emp_count ec 
ON 
    e.employee_id = ec.employee_id
WHERE 
    primary_flag = 'Y' 
    OR cnt_emp_id = 1;
