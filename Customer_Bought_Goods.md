```sql
WITH customer_grouped AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product_key ORDER BY product_key) AS g_product_key
    FROM 
        customer
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id
),

product_grouped AS (
    SELECT 
        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product_key ORDER BY product_key) AS g_product_key
    FROM 
        product
)

SELECT 
    cg.customer_id
FROM 
    customer_grouped cg, 
    product_grouped pg
WHERE 
    cg.g_product_key = pg.g_product_key;
